// Parent Nodes
The nodes in the DOM are referred to as parents, children, and siblings, depending on their relation to other nodes. The parent of any node is the node that is one level above it, or closer to the document in the DOM hierarchy. There are two properties to get the parent -- parentNode and parentElement.
